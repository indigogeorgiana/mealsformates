# MEALS FOR MATES

*M4M is a non-profit organisation aimed at making it easier for people to help the the homeless in New Zealand.*
Next time you eat out at one of our partnered stores, add a little to your bill at the end of the meal, even if it/s just a dollar... This will go towards a meal for someone who needs it the most.

# THE HOW

Work with the food bank, or food mission + various food establishments
M4M enables people to add a donation on top of their food bill at any of these establishments
People in need can then redeem a voucher for a meal from that store
